This PRC code is based off the PRC writer developed by Orest Shardt and Michaeil Vidiassov. It has been used by both MathGL and Asymptote. It is released under the LGPL v3.

We may also use HARU to write the PDF directly. HARU is licensed under ZLIB/LIBPNG. MathGL has a good example of how to use both the PRC writer and HARU. MathGL is GPL licensed.
